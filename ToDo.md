## Notes

- Each generator should produce step-by-step "visible scratchpad" solutions
- Steps use pipe-delimited op-codes (e.g., `D|18|5|3`)
- Final step must be `Z|<answer>`
- Consider difficulty levels within each generator
- Consider natural language variations for word problems
- Process check: after adding or modifying a generator, run `python dolphin_math_datagen.py --sample --generators <GeneratorName>` and verify the emitted steps match the exact human procedure for solving the problem.
- Design reminder: every recorded step should capture the same essential cues a human would write on paper (alignment, carries/borrows with source/target, etc.); prefer human-legible detail over terse machine-only notation.
- Mixed-number ops: ensure all four operations are represented (random wrapper included) and always emit simplify (`F`) and mixed-conversion (`IMPROPER_TO_MIX`) steps when applicable.
- **IMPORTANT:** After creating a new generator class, you MUST add it to the `ALL_GENERATORS` list in `dolphin_math_datagen.py`. This includes: (1) adding the import statement at the top of the file, and (2) adding an instance of the generator to the `ALL_GENERATORS` list. Failing to do this means the generator will not be included in dataset generation or sample output.
